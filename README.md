# Campus-Gruv-UI

These instructions are written assuming that you have android studio and jdk etc ( stuff mentioned in RN docs ) installed. If you don't,
kindly follow React Native docs first and follow REACT-NATIVE-CLI instructions.

Kindly notice that node -v10.16.3 is used so any issues regarding metro bundler not running should be gone after using this version.

After cloning this repo, run npm install.

Then go to ios using 'cd ios' command and run pod install.

You're good to go, run the app from android studio/ Xcode, or using react-native run-android/ios command.
